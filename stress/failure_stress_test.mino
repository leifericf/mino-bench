;; Focused stress tests for paths touched by abort-to-error conversions.
;; Each test runs many iterations of an operation that exercises
;; allocation-heavy code paths to verify no crashes, hangs, or leaks.
;;
;; Iteration counts are kept moderate so that MINO_GC_STRESS=1 (which
;; triggers GC on every allocation) completes in bounded time.
